/**
 * Intro:
 * 	Hello! This is my personal project on making a chess engine
 * I will be loosly following a guide and will try to make this
 * the way I want to. This is technically my first C project
 * that I am working on myself and it seems pretty interesting 
 * so I decided to do it. 
 * 
 * Representations:
 * 	Chess requires a way to represent:
 *		1. the board = int array
 * 		2. the pieces = different ints represent different pieces
 *		3. who's turn it is (side)
 *		4. the number of "plays" (half-moves) made in the game
 * 		5. other rule related things
